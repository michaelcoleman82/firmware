The purpose of this simulation is to understand the current flow of the product. In this example, the sheets are modeled by the two SPST switches, the 3v3 logic is pin 1 on the Pi. To the right of the switched are pulldown resistor configurations that is set up *internally* by the Pi.  The leds and the AND gate make up a simple representation of the sheet state and are **not** actual discreet components.  **No**  extra discreet component are needed for this product.
